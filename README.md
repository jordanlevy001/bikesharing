# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the NYC Citi Bike data from August 2019; then utilize these key findings/trends for a business proposal for a similar program in another city: Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

1. NYC Citi Bike General Info

This is the first story point that shows the total number of rides, the gender breakdown, usertype breakdown. It is helpful to have an understanding of how many people are using Citi Bikes. Furthermore, the gender breakdown is critical for this analysis, so this first storypoint provides the numbers of male/female/unknown users. There are 3 times more male users than female users. It also important to note that there are about 4 times more annual subscribers than short term customers.

2. August Peak Hours

This bar graph shows the number of bikes in use at each hour of the day. Peak usage occurs around 5pm to 7pm. This graph also provides insight for the ideal time for bike maintenance, the time when the usage is lowest.

3. Common Trip Duration

This chart displays the trip duration in minutes. You can filter this chart by the hour of the day. Most rides are under 30 minutes long.

4. Common Trip Duration by Gender

This chart is similar to the previous one, but it filters the trip duration data by gender: male, female, unknown. As we saw from the first story point, there are about 3 times more men using Citi Bikes. Although there are more men riding the Citi Bikes, most trip durations regardless of gender are still less than 30 minutes.

5. Common Riding Times by Weekday

This heat map shows the start times of all of the rides on each day of the week: Sunday to Saturday. There are spikes in rides occuring from 7am - 9am, which is a typical time people to commute to work. There is another spike from 5pm -7pm, which is a common time people leave work. On Saturdays and Sundays, most people don't work and are free during the day, which is likely why there are more people riding in the middle of the day on the weekends.
