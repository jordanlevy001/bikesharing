This is the first story point that shows the total number of rides, the gender breakdown, usertype breakdown. It is helpful to have an understanding of how many people are using Citi Bikes. Furthermore, the gender breakdown is critical for this analysis, so this first storypoint provides the numbers of male/female/unknown users. There are 3 times more male users than female users. It also important to note that there are about 4 times more annual subscribers than short term customers.
