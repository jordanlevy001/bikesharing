# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the NYC Citi Bike data from August 2019; then utilize these key findings/trends for a business proposal for a similar program in another city: Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

1. NYC Citi Bike General Info

This is the first story point that shows the total number of rides, the gender breakdown, usertype breakdown. It is helpful to have an understanding of how many people are using Citi Bikes. Furthermore, the gender breakdown is critical for this analysis, so this first storypoint provides the numbers of male/female/unknown users. There are 3 times more male users than female users. It also important to note that there are about 4 times more annual subscribers than short term customers.

2. August Peak Hours

This bar graph shows the number of bikes in use at each hour of the day. Peak usage occurs around 5pm to 7pm. This graph also provides insight for the ideal time for bike maintenance, the time when the usage is lowest.

3. Common Trip Duration

This chart displays the trip duration in minutes. You can filter this chart by the hour of the day. Most rides are under 30 minutes long.

This chart is similar to the previous one, but it splits the trip duration data by gender: male, female, unknown.
