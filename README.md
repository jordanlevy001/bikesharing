# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the NYC Citi Bike data from August 2019; then utilize these key findings/trends for a business proposal for a similar program in another city: Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results

1. NYC Citi Bike General Info

This is the first story point that shows the total number of rides, the gender breakdown, usertype breakdown. It is helpful to have an understanding of how many people are using Citi Bikes. Furthermore, the gender breakdown is critical for this analysis, so this first storypoint provides the numbers of male/female/unknown users. There are 3 times more male users than female users. It also important to note that there are about 4 times more annual subscribers than short term customers.



2. August Peak Hours

This bar graph shows the number of bikes in use at each hour of the day. Peak usage occurs around 5pm to 7pm. This graph also provides insight for the ideal time for bike maintenance, the time when the usage is lowest.



3. Common Trip Duration

This chart displays the trip duration in minutes. You can filter this chart by the hour of the day. Most rides are under 30 minutes long.



4. Common Trip Duration by Gender

<img width="1002" alt="Trip Duration by Gender" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88804543/142285923-ad9b5644-3c38-4497-9e11-4f58e20c1a14.png">

This chart is similar to the previous one, but it filters the trip duration data by gender: male, female, unknown. As we saw from the first story point, there are about 3 times more men using Citi Bikes. Although there are more men riding the Citi Bikes, most trip durations regardless of gender are still less than 30 minutes. You can filter this chart by gender and/or hour of the day.



5. Common Riding Times by Weekday

<img width="1000" alt="Common Riding Times by Weekday" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88804543/142284938-cb9eb5c9-470d-47bd-8276-c3b4103f6cb6.png">

This heat map shows the start times of all of the rides on each day of the week: Sunday to Saturday. There are spikes in rides occuring from 7am - 9am, which is a typical time people to commute to work. There is another spike from 5pm -7pm, which is a common time people leave work. On Saturdays and Sundays, most people don't work and are free during the day, which is likely why there are more people riding in the middle of the day on the weekends.



6. Common Riding Times by Weekday and Gender

<img width="1000" alt="Times by Weekday by Gender Male" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88804543/142286526-15c96656-b512-4e81-ae75-37371a935d81.png">

<img width="995" alt="Times by Weekday by Gender Unknown" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88804543/142286534-81c37fcf-b694-4134-8e2d-1bedd5d226b7.png">

This heat map is similar to the previous one (#5). It shows the riding times of all the rides on each day of the week, split up by gender (female, male, unknown). A very similar trend is observed between female and male riders: there are spikes in rides around the time people typically commute to and from work. But for the unknown gender data, rides typically occur in the middle of the day on Saturday and Sunday.



7. Common Riding Days by Gender and Usertype

<img width="988" alt="Common Weekdays by Gender Usertype" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88804543/142287362-680413c8-1000-4662-b33f-97fd13112df0.png">

This heat map shows the common weekdays rides occur filtered by gender (female, male, unknown) and usertype (customer, subscriber). A customer is a short term user and a subscriber has an annual subscription. There are more rides taken by subscribers than customers, which is consistent with the first story point, which showed there are 4 times more subscribers than customers.



8. Popular Starting Stations

<img width="1003" alt="Popular Starting Stations" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88804543/142287880-4154205b-fbee-420f-b3c8-479032987e00.png">

This bubble chart shows the locations of the starting points of all of the rides. The size of each bubble is relative to the number of rides starting in that location. The darker the green each bubble is is relative to the number of rides starting in that location.



9. Popular Ending Stations

<img width="1006" alt="Popular Ending Stations" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88804543/142288388-b8792231-2665-4a8a-b2c6-9f51d1da9d36.png">

This bubble chart shows the location of ending points of all of the rides. The size of each bubble is relative to the number of rides ending in that location. The darker the green each bubble is is relative to the number of rides ending in that location.
